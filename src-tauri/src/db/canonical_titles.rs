//! Canonical chapter titles for Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, and Śrī
//! Caitanya-caritāmṛta, ported verbatim from v2's
//! `VedaBaseModern2.Core.Metadata.CanonicalChapterTitles` (matching
//! vedabase.io's published chapter naming). That source notes three SB
//! chapters (10.87, 11.28, 11.29) had no extractable label and are
//! intentionally absent — callers fall back to a bare "Chapter N" for
//! those, exactly as v2 does.
//!
//! Deliberately does NOT cover NOD/KB/TLC/TQK/BB/ISO/NOI/BS — the real
//! `CanonicalChapterTitles.cs` file doesn't define those either, so
//! fabricating titles for them here would not be a real port.
